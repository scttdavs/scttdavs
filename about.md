## about scott

I'm a graphic designer and front end developer by trade. I live and work in New York City with my amazing fiance,
[Meg.](https://twitter.com/_margaretmac)
I work full time as a front end engineer with
[eBay,](http://www.ebay.com)
but I also freelance as well. Simplicity drives what I do in both design and development. It makes for both elegant and functional websites. Bright and vigrant colors, and the latest and greatest in development tools and languages also keep me going.

This site is the latest in a long line of iterations, all intended to be the last. I redesigned it this time to add a section for writing, as I want to make that a more important part of my process. As I work on projects, I encounter problems and issues that I think are common for all designers and developers and it would help others, as well as myself, to write them down, lest I repeat them again.

I may occasionally write about something not work related, and that's ok too.
