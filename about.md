## about scott

I'm a front end developer by trade (former graphic designer). I live and work in New York City with my amazing wife,
[Meg](https://twitter.com/megmkdavis) and our son.
I work full time as a front end engineer with
[eBay,](http://www.ebay.com) working on the homepage. Simplicity drives what I do in design and development. It makes for both elegant and functional websites. Bright and vibrant colors, and the latest and greatest in development tools and languages also keep me going.

This site is the latest in a long line of iterations, all intended to be the last. I redesigned it last time to add a section for writing, as I want to make that a more important part of my process. As I work on projects, I encounter problems that I think are common for all designers and developers and it would help others, as well as myself, to write them down, lest I repeat them again. I may occasionally write about something not work related, and that's ok too.

This latest add-on was photos, which I hope to share a lot of, as I may be a little obsessed with panoramic film photographs.
