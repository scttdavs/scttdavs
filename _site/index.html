<p>At my work, we use <a href="http://markojs.com">Marko</a> as our templating engine, which supports <a href="https://medium.com/ben-and-dion/progressive-rendering-a-killer-and-under-appreciated-feature-of-the-web-97c789b608c1">progressive rendering</a> out of the box. So maybe that is why I took it for granted when I decided I would try to implement the same thing for <a href="https://www.explorableplaces.com">Explorable Places</a>. There are a few pages there that are data-heavy and it would help</p>

</ul>

<p>“Scott! I need you!!”.</p>

<p>“Oh, Meg’s calling me, I got to go. I’ll talk to you later sis.”</p>

<p>I could tell from the sound in her voice what this was. I ran over to the bathroom, and the look on her face confirmed it.</p>

<p>“I think my water broke. I went to the bathroom and when I stood up I realized I was all wet. And I’m almost positive I was done, I don’t know what else it could be.”</p>

<p>I ran to the refrigerator and got the midwife’s card with their emergency number on it. We got the midwife on the phone and she congratulated us and gave us an expectation of what’s to come. It was good news, since it was 10:30 at night, Meg could take a bath to help with the ensuing contractions and try to get some sleep. Once the contractions wake her up and she couldn’t sleep through them, give her another call.</p>

<p>Sleeping through most of the early labor sounded good to both of us.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>I picked Theo up and was changing his diaper. It was around 6 or so in the morning. He had slept pretty well, but once I had him on the table, I noticed his legs looked like they may be a little bruised. I grabbed diaper, one of the ones from our baby shower and changed him. This one said “You can do it Dad!”. I wish we had kept track of who wrote what message on them!</p>

<p>I walked into the living room with Meg, “Hey, his legs are looking more bruised. I don’t how this could have happened. Was it the car seat? We didn’t have it THAT tight.. Are babies just that sensitive?”.</p>

<p>Two days earlier we took him home from the hospital in taxi. We had trouble getting him in the car seat since he was so long and none of us had ever used a car seat. Once we had help from the nurse, he was in but it was definitely a tight fit.</p>

<p>We’re growing more concerned at this point. “Let’s make an appointment for the pediatrician today if we can”. We both agreed and made the appointment later in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Meg was holding Theo and despite the bruising he seemed fine and happy. She was talking to him and making faces. She looked down at his little bruised legs and then at his diaper, “You can do it Dad!”. And then back at the bruising, and back at the diaper. The writing was in blue sharpie..</p>

<p>She called me over and we tried rubbing of the ink from his skin. Off it came. Even brushing your skin lightly on the diaper was enough for the ink to rub off. Holy shit, he’s fine.. and for two days we thought we were the worst, accidentally abusive parents. We’d worried if we’re breaking him on day 2, how will he ever live!</p>

<p>We immediately threw the rest of the written diapers away.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>I had the app open, Contraction Master. What a name.</p>

<p>“Ok, tell me when to start”.</p>

<p>“Now”</p>

<p>I started the timer and waited. Thirty seconds came and I expected her to tell me when to stop. It kept going and it got to a minute.</p>

<p>“Ok, it’s over now”.</p>

<p>A minute seemed a little long. I remember the classes we took, it should start off easy, like 30 seconds for an hour or more. Just a few minutes later, “Ok, another one’s coming!”.</p>

<p>About 40 minutes later I’d timed 5 or so contractions. Almost all of them were over a minute and some later ones were a minute to a minute and a half. I wondered if Meg was feeling them correctly beginning to end? Or was I timing them wrong? We’re getting a little worried at this point.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>I peaked into the side of Theo’s diaper, “no poop” I said. Meg sat on the bed, reading an article.</p>

<p>“It’s pretty full though, I’ll still change it.” Due to all the stories I’d heard, getting peed on seemed inevitable. But still, I always stand to the side, never in the line of fire. If he was going to get me, he was going to have to go out of his way to do it.</p>

<p>I had his diaper off and lubed his bottom up with vaseline, I was getting his diaper ready it happened. A brownish yellow stream of poop shot straight out of his vaseline coated butt, at what must have been only 5 degree angle. It left the changing, pad, the edge of the changing table, and another foot and a half, and plunged straight into the mesh siding of the bassinet, splitting the poop stream into smaller poop streams.</p>

<p>My eyes were wide open and I just stared in shock. I must have said something because Meg noticed and came running over. What amazing team work we had, without saying much we literally leaped into action. Meg leaped a little bit into the puddle of poop on the floor, but it was ok, because we were on this!</p>

<p>I used 5, maybe 10 wipes to furiously clean up his butt, and also the changing pad. Thank God we got the kind that doesn’t need the cloth cover! It’s amazing how difficult it is to wipe up poop from the pad while keeping his kicking legs from getting all in it as well.</p>

<p>Meg worked on the floor, this required some heavy duty paper towels, and several wet wipes to finish the job. Then came the bassinet, the poor poor bassinet. After some soap and water, you could still see some yellow staining if you knew where to look. But what else could we do? Theo made his bed, and now he’ll have to lie in it.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>We had called the midwife again, the other one had finished her shift and Jo had just started. She said to call back when Meg could not talk through a contraction any more. She was visibly in a lot of pain, and it was hard for me to imagine so much she couldn’t talk through. Her water broke about an hour and a half ago. We were supposed to be able to sleep through the night. We hadn’t even been able to finish our dinner after all of this started.</p>

<p>Her contractions were coming faster and faster. The bath did not help. She was now sitting on the toilet when a particularly bad one hit. She was sitting there because she was feeling nauseous and the tub was close by. She was bent over in pain and vomitted in the tub. I’ve never felt so helpless in my life. So much I also had a heaping of guilt. We called the midwife yet again. I’m sure she loved hearing back from us so soon. This time we had her on the phone again and when another contraction came. She was able to hear Meg through the whole thing. She could nothing but scream and cry out. Bent over her face was red and writhed in agony. It was then and only then, after all the long and close together contractions, after the vomit in the tub, and hearing Meg over the phone that.</p>

<p>“I think it would be good now to start getting ready to leave. There’s no rush, and I’ll meet you both at the hospital”.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>No rush!? No rush?! I ran around like the proverbial chicken with its head cut off. Our hospital bag was packed but not all the way. I grabbed a sponge and scooped the puke out of the tub and into a bucket that I could flush down the toilet. We couldn’t leave that there for two day.</p>

<p>I ran around and got a garbage bag, towel, hospital bag and called a car. This was really happening.</p>

<p>A funny story about me is how I got into web development. It essentially boiled down to me learning, and then becoming obsessed with, <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/62/6241.html" target="\_blank">making programs on my TI-83 Plus calculator</a> in a BASIC-like language designed just for the calculator. This made it a perfect portable IDE for someone learning how to program. I made <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/288/28883.html" target="\_blank">minesweeper</a>, <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/295/29524.html" target="\_blank">lights out</a>, <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/296/29633.html" target="\_blank">D-Star (with custom level editor, I might add)</a>, and a program to view fractals! Well, apparently I forgot</p>

<p>My whole life, I don’t think I had given this question too much thought. Despite being raised and confirmed Catholic, it was one of those things that just goes in one ear and comes out the other. Grace is to be graceful, elegant, smooth, whatever. That’s about as much as I knew or cared.</p>

<p>Being the lapsed Catholic that I am, it wasn’t until a couple decades later where I met my wife that I encountered this concept first hand, and no, it wasn’t with her. It was with her dad.</p>
